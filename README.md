## **Image Processing Algorithm: Development Phase 1**

The objective of this project is to develop a **real-time motion detection and tracking system** using camera-acquired images. The system will detect movement within a scene and visually mark detected objects, making it applicable to **security systems, surveillance applications, and interactive systems**.

The project development follows a structured approach, consisting of the following key stages:

### **Development Phase 1: Motion Detection System Workflow**

1. **Camera Connection**: The system begins by establishing a connection to a video source, which can be either a **webcam or an IP camera**. The system continuously retrieves frames from the selected source. *(Note: Alternative techniques may be explored as the project progresses.)*

2. **Capturing the Initial Frame**: To detect motion, the system captures an initial reference frame upon startup. This frame serves as a baseline for comparison with subsequent frames to identify any changes in the scene.

3. **Preprocessing the Image**: Each captured frame undergoes a series of preprocessing steps before further analysis. These include **grayscale conversion, noise reduction (e.g., blurring), and other enhancement techniques** to improve detection accuracy.

4. **Change Detection**: The system calculates the difference between the **current processed frame** and the **reference frame** to identify regions where significant pixel changes have occurred. If the difference exceeds a predefined threshold, the area is classified as **motion**.

5. **Marking Motion-Detected Areas**: Once motion is detected, **bounding boxes** are drawn around the moving objects within the frame. This provides a clear visual representation of detected activity.

6. **Displaying the Results**: The processed frame, initial reference frame, and detected motion areas are displayed within the user interface, allowing for real-time monitoring.

7. **User Interaction & System Exit**: The user can **interact with the system to modify parameters or manually stop the program**. The system will terminate upon receiving a specific user input (e.g., pressing a designated key) or upon meeting an exit condition.

This structured development roadmap provides a clear implementation path for the project. Each stage is carefully planned to ensure **reliable, efficient, and accurate real-time motion detection**.

### **Image Processing Algorithm: Development Phase 2**

To achieve optimal results in this project, the **"Local Prototype Development"** phase is designed as a preliminary step before deploying the system on the **PYNQ Z2 board**. Below are key technical insights into the integration of this system with PYNQ Z2.

- The project leverages the **OpenCV library** optimized for the PYNQ Z2 board, ensuring smooth execution on the **Processing System (PS)**. This integration allows for efficient image processing while utilizing Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- The following functions outline the core steps of the **Development Phase 1**, forming the foundation for the **Prototype Development** phase.

The following code captures frames from a live camera feed, processes them in real-time, and displays the output.

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    processed = process_image(frame)
    cv2.imshow("Processed", processed)
```

### **1. Initializing Video Stream**
   - The **`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`** function initializes a video stream from a local **webcam**. Here, **`0`** typically refers to the default connected camera.

### **2. Capturing the Initial Frame**
   - The **`cap.read()`** function retrieves the first frame from the video stream. This frame acts as a **reference point** for motion detection.
   - The initial frame is **converted to grayscale** using **`cv2.cvtColor`** and **Gaussian blur** is applied via **`cv2.GaussianBlur`** to reduce high-frequency noise, stabilizing motion detection accuracy.

### **3. Continuous Frame Acquisition & Processing**
   - In a loop, each new frame is read, **converted to grayscale**, and processed using the same blurring techniques.
   - The function **`cv2.absdiff`** computes the absolute difference between the initial frame and the current frame, highlighting motion regions.

### **4. Processing the Difference Image**
   - A threshold is applied using **`cv2.threshold`**, separating significant changes (white pixels) from the background (black pixels). The threshold value (set to **30**) determines the sensitivity of motion detection.

### **5. Contour Detection**
   - The **`cv2.findContours`** function detects white areas in the thresholded difference image, identifying motion regions.
   - The **`cv2.contourArea`** function calculates the area of each contour, and those exceeding **1000 pixels** are considered valid motion events, filtering out minor noise.

### **6. Drawing Bounding Boxes**
   - Each detected contour is enclosed in a **bounding box** using **`cv2.boundingRect`**, visually highlighting the detected motion in the original frame.

### **7. Displaying Processed Frames**
   - The **initial reference frame, current processed frame, and motion-detected regions** are displayed via **`cv2.imshow`**, providing real-time feedback.

### **8. Termination of the Program**
   - In each loop iteration, **`cv2.waitKey(30)`** waits for user input for **30 milliseconds**.
   - If the **`Esc`** key (ASCII value **27**) is pressed, the loop terminates, and the video feed, along with all windows, is closed.

This structured development approach ensures efficient real-time motion detection, leveraging both software-based image processing and FPGA acceleration for enhanced performance.
